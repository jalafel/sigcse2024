Assignment Title: Building Blocks of a Text-Based Adventure Game

Objective: To gradually introduce and apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops.

Tasks:

Variables and Basic Input/Output: Write a program that asks the player for their name and a choice of path (e.g., "left" or "right"). Store these inputs in variables and print a message that includes the player's name and chosen path.

Conditionals: Expand your program to include conditional statements. If the player chooses "left", print one outcome (e.g., "You encounter a dragon!"), and if they choose "right", print a different outcome (e.g., "You find a treasure chest!").

Loops: Now introduce a loop into your program. After the player makes a choice and sees the outcome, ask them if they want to play again. If they say "yes", the game should loop back to the start and let them choose a path again. The game should continue looping until the player chooses to stop playing.

Combining Concepts: Finally, combine all these concepts to create a simple text-based game. The game should involve a series of choices, with different outcomes for each choice. Use variables to keep track of the player's progress, conditionals to handle the player's choices, and a loop to keep the game running until the player decides to quit.

Submission: Submit your code files on the course's learning management system by the due date.

Grading: You will be graded on the functionality of your code, the clarity and organization of your code, your use of the programming concepts listed above, and your testing and debugging process.

This assignment should give students a practical experience in applying the fundamental programming concepts and gradually build up to the concept of control flow.
