Assignment Title: Building a Simple Weather Dashboard

Objective: To apply basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and API usage to build a simple weather dashboard.

Tasks:

Weather API: Research and choose a free weather API that provides current weather data. Write a function to fetch weather data for a given location.

Data Processing: Write functions to process the fetched data. These functions should extract and return useful information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

User Input: Write a function to take a location as input from the user. This function should handle potential errors in user input.

Displaying Data: Write a function to display the processed weather data in a user-friendly format.

Main Program: Write a main program that ties all the above components together. The program should take a location as input, fetch and process the weather data for that location, and display the data.

Submission: Submit your code files on the course's learning management system by the due date.

Grading: You will be graded on the functionality of your code, the clarity of your code organization and comments, and your handling of potential errors.

Note: This assignment assumes that students have been introduced to the basics of a programming language and API usage. If not, these topics will need to be covered before the assignment is given.
