Assignment Title: Building a Simple Text-Based Adventure Game

Objective: To apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, coding style, modular design, testing, and debugging.

Tasks:

Game Design: Design a simple text-based adventure game. The game could involve navigating a series of rooms, each with different options or challenges. Use variables to store the player's current location, inventory, and game state.

Control Flow: Use conditionals and loops to control the flow of the game. For example, you could use a loop to keep the game running until the player reaches a certain condition (like finding a treasure or reaching the exit), and conditionals to handle the player's choices.

Functions: Break your code down into functions, each handling a specific part of the game. For example, you could have functions for displaying the player's current status, handling player input, updating the game state, etc.

Arrays: Use arrays to manage collections of items or locations in your game.

Coding Style and Modular Design: Write your code in a clear and organized manner. Use comments to document your code and make it easier to understand.

Testing and Debugging: Test your game thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Use debugging techniques to identify and fix any issues.

Submission: Submit your code files on the course's learning management system by the due date.

Grading: You will be graded on the functionality of your game, the clarity and organization of your code, your use of the programming concepts listed above, and your testing and debugging process.

This assignment should give students a practical experience in applying the fundamental programming concepts listed in your outcomes.
